Just think of speech or image recognition. Most of the systems rely on either powerful processors or a direct connection to the cloud for doing the calculations up there. With the increasing power of modern processors the AI systems are coming closer to the end user - which is usually called edge computing. Here this edge computing is brought into a practice-oriented example, where a AI network is implemented on a ESP32 device so: AI on the edge.</p>"},{"location":"#key-features","title":"Key features","text":"<ul> <li>Tensorflow Lite (TFlite) integration - including easy to use wrapper</li> <li>Inline image processing (feature detection, alignment, ROI extraction)</li> <li>Small and cheap device (3x4.5x2 cm\u00b3, &lt; 10 EUR)</li> <li>Camera and illumination integrated</li> <li>Web surface to administrate and control</li> <li>OTA-Interface to update directly through the web interface</li> <li>Full integration into Home Assistant</li> <li>Support for Influx DB 1 and 2</li> <li>MQTT</li> <li>REST API</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#idea","title":"Idea","text":""},{"location":"#hardware","title":"Hardware","text":""},{"location":"#web-interface","title":"Web interface","text":""},{"location":"#configuration-interface","title":"Configuration Interface","text":"<p>Have fun in studying the new possibilities and ideas</p> <p>This is about image recognition and digitalization, done totally on a cheap ESP32 board using artificial intelligence in form of convolutional neural networks (CNN).

The user interface is an integrated web server, that can be easily adjusted and offers the data as an API in different options.</p> <p>The task to be demonstrated here is an automated readout of an analog water meter. The water consumption is to be recorded within a house automatization and the water meter is totally analog without any electronic interface. Therefore, the task is solved by regularly taking an image of the water meter and digitizing the reading.</p> <p>There are two types of CNN implemented, a classification network for reading the digital numbers and a single output network for digitalize the analog pointers for the sub digit readings.</p> <p>This project is an evolution of the water-meter-system-complete, which uses ESP32-CAM just for taking the image and a 1GB-Docker image to run the neural network's backbone.
