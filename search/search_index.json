This is the documentation. For the source code, please head to github.com/jomjol/AI-on-the-edge-device . Artificial intelligence based systems have been established in our everyday lives. Just think of speech or image recognition. Most of the systems rely on either powerful processors or a direct connection to the cloud for doing the calculations up there. With the increasing power of modern processors the AI systems are coming closer to the end user - which is usually called edge computing . Here this edge computing is brought into a practice-oriented example, where a AI network is implemented on a ESP32 device so: AI on the edge . Key features Tensorflow Lite (TFlite) integration - including easy to use wrapper Inline image processing (feature detection, alignment, ROI extraction) Small and cheap device (3x4.5x2 cm\u00b3, < 10 EUR) Camera and illumination integrated Web surface to administrate and control OTA-Interface to update directly through the web interface Full integration into Home Assistant Support for Influx DB 1 MQTT REST API Idea Hardware Web interface Configuration Interface Have fun in studying the new possibilities and ideas This is about image recognition and digitalization, done totally on a cheap ESP32 board using artificial intelligence in form of convolutional neural networks (CNN). Everything, from image capture (OV2640), image preprocessing (auto alignment, ROI identification) all the way down to the image recognition (CNN structure) and result plausibility is done on a cheap 10 EUR device. This all is integrated in an easy to do setup and use environment, taking care for all the background processing and handling, including regular job scheduler. The user interface is an integrated web server, that can be easily adjusted and offers the data as an API in different options. The task to be demonstrated here is an automated readout of an analog water meter. The water consumption is to be recorded within a house automatization and the water meter is totally analog without any electronic interface. Therefore, the task is solved by regularly taking an image of the water meter and digitizing the reading. There are two types of CNN implemented, a classification network for reading the digital numbers and a single output network for digitalize the analog pointers for the sub digit readings. This project is an evolution of the water-meter-system-complete , which uses ESP32-CAM just for taking the image and a 1GB-Docker image to run the neural network's backbone. Here everything is integrated in an ESP32-CAM module with 8MB of RAM and a SD card as data storage.","title":"Welcome"},{"location":"#welcome","text":"Welcome to the AI-on-the-edge-device project!

This is explained here. There are several reasons, that a check might be necessary: In case of digits there is the output of \"N\" (=NaN = Not-a-Number) in case the digit cannot be detected correctly. This happens for example if the image shows a digit between to states The replacement of the \"N\" with a previous value could be not sufficient, due to the fact, that it might have changed. There is a misreading of one one of the numbers. This can always happen in case of neural network processing. Terms and definitions PreValue The last correct read value. PreValue is here a bit missleading, because normally it is the same as the last value. In the next round of reading it will be used to check nagtive rates, high rates (MaxRateValue / MaxRateType) and CCheckDigitIncreaseConsistency (dig-class11 only). Either from a previous correctly identified value or manual setting by the user. Digits Value that are digitized from a digital number. There are 11 allowed values for this: Digits: 0, 1, 2, ... 9 N = Not-a-Number - representing a not unique state between two numbers Analogs This are value derived from a pointer like meter. This never has the state \"N\". CheckDigitIncreaseConsistency If this is enabled an \"intelligent\" algorithm is used to derive from zero-crossing of discrete digit positions, if the number should have been increased. This is relevant because in some of the digit meters, the increase of a digit to the next number can be seen, before the sub-digit has gone through zero. For example: 16.6 --> 16.7 --> 1N.8 --> 17.9 corrected to 16.9 --> 17.0 --> 17.1 As you can see, the 17.9 is a false reading as the 7 is assumed to be already readable, although the sub-digit has not crossed the zero. In this case the CheckDigitIncreaseConsistency algorithm will correct this to 16.9 A detailed description of the algorithm can be found below (not yet ready!) AllowNegativeRates Most of the meters only have increasing numbers and do not count backwards. Therefore a negative rate (= negative change compared to the PreValue) is surely a false value. This can be checked an flagged as false reading The AllowNegativeRates property ensures that the result does not become negative in the event of incorrect readings. This can happen, for example, if the alignment of the image did not work properly. But also the neural networks sometimes flip between two states for similar images. If AllowNegativeRates = true , the result is discarded if it is smaller than the pre-value of the last readout and the output shows an error \"Negative rate..\" If the ExtendedResolution setting is true, there is an exception where the value does not become smaller, but no error is output. This only applies if the value +/- 0.2 of the last digit is inaccurate. DecimalShift The DecimalShift setting puts the decimal point in the right place. It acts like a shift. Negative values shift the decimal point to the left. Positive values move the decimal point to the right, filling with zero. AnalogDigitalTransitionStart For detailed description see Analog-digital-transition . MaxRateValue and MaxRateType Here the maximum change from one to the next reading can be limited. If a false reading of the neural network results in a change larger than this, the reading is flagged as false. There a two types of comparisons possible 1) AbsolutChange : Here the difference between the PreValue and the current reading is compared directly, independent how much time has passed since the last reading. 2) RelativeRate : in this case a change rate in the unit of change/minute is calculated, taking the time between the last and the current reading into account. Be careful, that with increasing time, the absolute allowed change increases. Example: relative rate of 0.05 m\u00b3/minute --> after 20 minutes a maximum change of 20 minutes * 0.05 m\u00b3/minute = 1 m\u00b3 is possible. That means that a false reading of 1 m\u00b3 cannot be detected false after about 20 minutes in this case Assume, that there might be no change in the meter for hours (e.g. during the night) a much bigger change could also be accepted. ExtendedResolution Newer models such as dig-cont and dig-class100 have a high resolution of the values and can thus represent another digit by using the value of the last digit or pointer (ex. 7.8 in the last digit). If the value is set to true, the result of the last digit is used completely. When using dig-class11 models, the setting is ignored. Due to inaccuracies of the neural networks, it sometimes happens that the results jump back and forth between two decimal places. Therefore, when using `\u00c0llowNegatives``= false, no error is output if the value is only off by 0.2. Nevertheless, the value then remains at the higher determined value. IgnoreLeadingNaN The parameter is only be used, if a dig-class11 model is selected. \u00ccgnoreLeadingNaN removes in the CheckDigitIncreaseConsistency process the leading N values. Flow Chart CheckDigitIncreaseConsistency Algorithm The check digit increase consistency algorithm is functional for the digits only. Due to the fact, that the rotation might be a little bit earlier or later compared to the zero crossing of the digit before, errors during the reading before and after a zero crossing can be wrong. Therefore a simple algorithm can be applied, checking the consistency of zero crossing and changes in the following digit. This is applied to one after the other digit, starting with the lowest priority digits.","title":"Correction Algorithm"},{"location":"Correction%20Algorithm/#correction-algorithm","text":"After the digitization of the images and the composition to a number a checking and correction algorithm is applied.

There are several reasons for frequent reboots: Frequent HTML requests Wrong configuration, missing configuration files Unstable hardware - see Hardware Compatibility . There is a dedicated page about this: Frequent Reboots . How accurate are the detections? It is hard to give a specific accuracy number. It depends on many factors, e.g. How in-focus is your camera? How sturdy is the camera mount? Does it slightly move over extended periods of time? What type of meter are you reading? Is the meter already in the training data set? Are you trying to read digits, an analog dial, or both? etc. Anecdotally, the authors of this page have great success with the meter. While the AI algorithm itself is not perfect and sometimes returns NaN or incorrect values, other post-processing / prevalue / sanity checks help ensure such invalid values are filtered out. With the correct settings, one author has been running this device for 1 month without any incorrect values reported. See the FAQs below for more details and configuration hints. My numbers are not correctly detected. What can I do? There is a dedicated page about the correct setting ROI Configuration . This page also includes the instructions for gathering new images for the training. How can I ensure invalid numbers are never reported? As mentioned above, the AI algorithm is not perfect. Sometimes it may read an incorrect value. We can tune the software to almost never report an incorrect value. There is a tradeoff though: the software may report stale values - i.e. it will drop incorrect values for a potentially long period of time, resulting in the meter reading being outdated by hours. If never receiving an incorrect value is important to you, consider tolerating this tradeoff. You can change the following settings to reduce incorrect readings (but potentially increase staleness of data): Set a prevalue via the UI, then change PostProcessing configuration option PreValueAgeStartup to a much larger number (e.g. 43200 = 30 days). Change PostProcessing configuration option MaxRateType to be time based instead of absolute. Set MaxRateValue to something realistic (e.g. 5 gal/min). You can often find the max flow rate your meter supports directly on the cover. Reduce AutoTimer configuration option Interval to the lowest it can be (e.g. 3 min). The more often you take readings, the less likely for data staleness to occur. Even after I have setup everything perfect there is a false reading - especially around the zero crossing (roll over to next number) The roll over behavior is different for the different meters. E.g.: Rolling over start with different previous position (e.g. at 7, 8 or 9) The neutral position (no rolling) is not perfectly at zero, but rather at something like 7.9 or 8.1, even if it should be exactly 8 The \"PostProcessingAlgo\" is trying to judge out of the individual readings, what number it should be. For example if the previous number is a \"1\", but the next number seems to be a \"8.9\", most probably there was a \"zero crossing\" and the number is a \"9\" and not still an \"8\" Currently the setting of the algorithm is set to fit most of the meters and cases. But the parameters do not fit perfectly for all situations. Therefore there might be intermediate states, where the reading is false. This is especially the case, at the positions, where the roll over (zero crossing) is just starting. To prevent a sending of false parameters, there is the possibility to limit the maximum allowed change (MaxRateChange). Usually after some time and movement of the counters a bit further, the reading is getting back to a stable reading. To handle this, a parametrized setting would be needed. This is rather complicated to implement as subtle changes make a relevant difference. Currently this is not implemented. So please be a bit patient with your meter :-) Pre-Value PreValue is here a bit missleading, because normally it is the same as the last value. In the next round of reading it will be used to check nagtive rates, high rates (MaxRateValue / MaxRateType) and CCheckDigitIncreaseConsistency (dig-class11 only). Either from a previous correctly identified value or manual setting by the user. If you use post processes, enable the pre-value. The pre-value must be set at first time. Set it to the current raw value. If the device runs in errors, the pre-value will not be updated, as long as the preValueAgeStartup time between the last valid value (or startup time) and current time is not exceeded. After it the preValue will be set again, if no other error occured. So the device can not run in an endless error, like high rate. \"Rate too high - Read: ...\" In configuration you can set the MaxRateValue and MaxRateType . The settings suppress improbably high values that can come from false readings. To do this, the value must be set correctly depending on your meter. Before doing this, you should be clear about the type of rating you want to use. \"Absolute change\" is the interval between two readings - no matter how often the readings happen. \"RateCange\" is the change per minute. This is calculated from the time difference between the last and the current reading. If there is an interval of 5 minutes between readings and a MaxRateValue of 1, an error \"Rate too high - Read: ...\" if Absolute change: the difference is > 1 RateChange: the difference is > 1 / 5 Train on my own images Look at Learn models with your own images and Cookbook running the jupyter notebook with my own data .","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"FAQs/#frequently-asked-questions","text":"","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"FAQs/#my-device-reboots-frequently-what-can-i-do","text":"There are several reasons for frequent reboots: Frequent HTML requests Wrong configuration, missing configuration files Unstable hardware - see Hardware Compatibility .

E.g.: Rolling over start with different previous position (e.g. at 7, 8 or 9) The neutral position (no rolling) is not perfectly at zero, but rather at something like 7.9 or 8.1, even if it should be exactly 8 The \"PostProcessingAlgo\" is trying to judge out of the individual readings, what number it should be. For example if the previous number is a \"1\", but the next number seems to be a \"8.9\", most probably there was a \"zero crossing\" and the number is a \"9\" and not still an \"8\" Currently the setting of the algorithm is set to fit most of the meters and cases. But the parameters do not fit perfectly for all situations. Therefore there might be intermediate states, where the reading is false. This is especially the case, at the positions, where the roll over (zero crossing) is just starting. To prevent a sending of false parameters, there is the possibility to limit the maximum allowed change (MaxRateChange). Usually after some time and movement of the counters a bit further, the reading is getting back to a stable reading. To handle this, a parametrized setting would be needed. This is rather complicated to implement as subtle changes make a relevant difference. Currently this is not implemented.

Either from a previous correctly identified value or manual setting by the user. If you use post processes, enable the pre-value. The pre-value must be set at first time.

If it's not stable the device tents to sporadic reboots (brownout detection) In general: There are several mechanisms in the firmware (like saving previous values), to have a \"smooth\" reboot without too many notable disturbance. System instabilities If your system is sometimes running smoothly over several runs and sometimes reboots obviously randomly, you have an partially unstable device.

There is hardware (ESP32CAM), where only 2-3 stable rounds are possible and others, where way more than 100 rounds without any reboots is possible. There is noting you can do about it, beside testing different hardware. Overload during HTML access If you frequently access the web server over HTML requests, the firmware tends to reboot. This especially happens during the first run and when the ESP32 is busy with the digitization flow. The reason for this are running out of memory during a flow, minor memory leakage in combination with missing error handling. There is noting you can do about this kind of reboot, beside two thing: Support the firmware development with improved and tested part of code Be patient :-) Bad or insufficient power supply A good and stabilized power supply is essential to have error free operation. The device is quite picky in terms of proper power supply. Especially the wifi module have some load spikes which the power supply needs to cover.

It can be easily found on the typical internet stores, searching for ESP32-CAM for less than 10 EUR. How ever since the hardware is cheap and coming from China, you unluckily could pick a malfunctioning device. See Hardware Compatibility for further advice! USB->UART interface For first time flashing the firmware a USB -> UART connector is needed. Later firmware upgrades than can be flashed via OTA. Power supply For power supply a 5V source is needed. Most easily this can be done via a USB power supply. The power supply should support minimum 500mA. For buffering current peaks some users reported to use a large electrolytic capacitor like a 2200uF between ground and VCC. \u203c\ufe0f Attention: in several internet forums there are problems reported, in case the ESP32-CAM is only supplied with 3.3V. Housing A small 3D-printable example for a very small case can be found in Thingiverse here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4571627 \u203c\ufe0f Attention : the focus of the OV2640 needs to be adjusted, as it is normally set from ~40cm to infinity. In order to get an image that is big enough, it needs to be changed to about 10cm. Therefore the sealing glue on the objective ring needs to be removed with a scalpel or sharp knife. Afterwards the objective can be rotated clockwise until the image is sharp again. Wiring Beside the 5V power supply, only for the first flashing a connection to the USB-UART connector, including a short cut of GPIO0 to GND for bootloader start. A example for wiring can be found here: It is also possible to use external LEDs for the illumination instead of the internal flash LED. This is described here 2. Firmware Web Installer There is a Web Installer available which will work right out of the web browser Edge and Chrome. You can access it with the following link: Web Installer This is the preferred way for beginners as it also allows access to the USB Log: Manual Flashing Files Grab the firmware from the Releases page (Stable, tested versions), or the Automatically build development branch (experimental, untested versions). Please have a look on Living on the Edge first! You need: partitions.bin bootloader.bin firmware.bin Flashing using the Flash Tool from Espressif (GUI) Get the Flash Download Tool from Espressif. Download and extract the Flash tool, after starting choose \"Developer Mode\", then \"ESP32-DownloadTool\" and you are in the setup of the flashing tool. Connect the ESP32-CAM with the USB-UART connection and identify the COM-Port. \u203c\ufe0f Attention : if you are re-flashing the code again, it is strongly recommended to erase the flash memory before flashing the firmware. Especially if you used OTA in between, which might cause remaining information on the flash, to still boot from an old image in the OTA-area, which is not erased by a normal flash. But your ESP32 in bootloader mode and push start, then it will identify the board and you can configure the bin-configuration according to the following table: Filename Offset bootloader.bin 0x1000 partitions.bin 0x8000 firmware.bin 0x10000 Flashing using the Python based esptool (Console) For this you need a python environment (e.g. Anaconda in Win10). Here you need to install the esptool: pip install esptool Then connect the ESP32 with the USB-UART connector to the system, put it in boot mode and with the following command you can erase the flash and flash bootloader, partitions and firmware in two steps: esptool erase_flash esptool write_flash 0x01000 bootloader.bin 0x08000 partitions.bin 0x10000 firmware.bin Maybe you need to specify the COM-port if it is not detected by default. If the erase command throws the error A fatal error occurred: ESP32 ROM does not support function erase_flash. , your esptool might be too old, see https://techoverflow.net/2022/02/08/how-to-fix-esp32-a-fatal-error-occurred-esp32-rom-does-not-support-function-erase_flash/ With some Python installations this may not work and you\u2019ll receive an error, try python -m pip install esptool or pip3 install esptool . Further recommendations can be found on the espressif webpage . 3. SD Card The software expects an SD card prepared with certain directory and file structure in order to work properly. SD card most top directory should look like this: This initial setup needs only to be done once as further updates (Firmware as well as SD card content) are possible with the Over-The-Air Update mechanism. Notes Due to the limited availability of GPIOs (OV2640, Flash-Light, PSRAM & SD card) the communication mode to the SD card is limited to 1-line SD-Mode. It showed up, that this results in problems with very large SD-Cards (64GB, sometimes 32 GB) and some no name low cost SD-cards. There must be no partition table on the SD-card (no GPT, but only MBR for the single partition) Following setting are necessary for formatting the SD-card: SINGLE PARTITION, MBR, FAT32 - 32K. NOT exFAT Some ESP32 devices share their SD-card and/or camera GPIOs with the pins for TX and RX. If you see errors like \u201cFailed to connect\u201d then your chip is probably not entering the bootloader properly. Remove the respective modules temporarily to free the GPIOs for flashing. You may find more information about troubleshooting on the homepage of Espressif . The ESP32 indicates problems with the SD card during startup with a fast, endless blinking. In this case, please try another SD card. Manual Setup with an SD Card Reader on a PC Take the AI-on-the-edge-device__manual-setup__*.zip from the Release page. Open it and extract the sd-card.zip . Open it and extract all files onto onto your SD card. On the SD card, open the wlan.ini file and configure it as needed: Set the corresponding SSID and password The other parameters are optional Note: The device provides a File Server which can be used to show, edit or delete the files on the SD card. For security reasons, the wlan.ini file is excluded from this and is hidden from external access to protect the password. After this, you can insert the SD card into the ESP32 board and start it. Remote Setup using the built-in Access Point On startup of the ESP32, it checks if the wlan.ini or the config/config.ini are available on the SD card. If not, the ESP32 switches to a special mode. In this mode, it provides a Wifi Access Point which can be used to add the missing wlan.ini or the config/config.ini file. Take the AI-on-the-edge-device__remote-setup__*.zip from the Release page. Connect to Access Point of the device. The SSID is \"AI-on-the-Edge\" and you can access it without any password: The device has the following fixed IP: http://192.168.4.1 . Upload initial configuration to SD card Use the select file and upload button to start the upload. A warning will show up if you have chosen a possible wrong file (without default configuration). Store WLAN access information. After the upload, a new page will be shown: Enter your SSID and password. Note: Only basic settings are supported. If you need advanced configuration (fixed ip, ...), you need to use the manual setup as documented above. \u203c\ufe0f Attention: Carefully check your wifi settings. To change them later on, you need to take out the SD card and edit the wlan.ini manually (or delete it and start again). The information is transferred without encryption! Finish the step by pushing Write wlan.ini Reboot The final step is the reboot: \u203c\ufe0f Warning: It will take up to 3 minutes. Afterwards you can find your device in the local network. Check your router for the IP. You can find it also in the USB Console output. 4. Initial Startup After the firmware is flashed and the SD card is setup properly, you can start it. After power on the connection status is indicated by 3x blinking of the red on board LED. WLAN-Status indication: 5 x fast blinking (< 1 second): connection still pending 3 x slow blinking (1 second on/off): WLAN connection established Note: It is normal that at first one or two times a pending connection is indicated.","title":"Installation"},{"location":"Installation/#installation","text":"The installation requires multiple steps: Get the right hardware and wire it up Flash the firmware onto the ESP32 Write the data to the SD card Start it For point 2 and 3 we provide multiple ways to do it.

This section is describing the different types of neural networks, that are used with the AI-on-the-edge approach and gives an introduction on how and where to use them. Overview neural network type There are two types of input : digits with rolling number (top town) analog pointers (clockwise rotating pointer) There are two types of neural networks : classification networks with discrete output neurons for each result class: 11 classes for digits (0, 1, ... 8, 9 + \"Not-A-Number\") 100 classes for digits or analog pointers (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ... , 9.7, 9.8, 9.9) continuous output networks with a continuous output in the interval [0, 10[ No setting of the type in the firmware is necessary. The type can detect by the output structure automatically. \u203c\ufe0f Attention: It is very important to choose the right network type (digits or analog pointers). Technically a wrong network will work and create output, but that would be totally arbitrary Not all type of pointers are trained in all networks. For the 11 classes digits network there many different types of digits trained. The reason is, that you 1) only need 20-30 training images and 2) the data collection is ongoing much longer For the continuous and 100 classes network especially for the digits, there are only a few types of digits trained up to now Therefore sometimes for the digits it is more effective to choose the simpler 11 classes network type (= default). Naming convention Classification 11 classes 0, 1, ... 9 + \"N\" Classification 100 classes 0.0, 0.1, ... 9.9 Continuous Interval [0, 10[ Digits dig-class11 _XXX.tflite dig-class100 _XXX.tflite dig-cont _XXX.tflite Analog Pointers ana-class100 _XXX.tflite ana-cont _XXX.tflite XXX contains the versioning and a parameter for different sizes with the following naming: XXX = versioning_sY versioning = version or in newer networks the training data Y = Neural network size (typically s1, s2, ..., s4). Whereas s1 is the maximum sized neural network and s4 is the smallest. Optional the naming ends with an \"_q\" to signal, that the tflite file has been quantized (size reduction with minimum accuracy loss). Example: dig-class11_1410_s2_q.tflite Classification network for digits with 11 classes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, N) Version 1410 = 14.1.0 s2 = Size 2 (Medium) q = Quantized Version Overview of trained types and details Analog Pointer (\"ana-cont_XXX.tflite\" & \"ana-class100_XXX.tflite\") This is to transfer the direction of a pointer into a continuous number between 0 and 1, whereas 0 (=1) is the upwards position (12 o'clock), 0.25 corresponds to the 3 o'clock positions and so on. This network is a envelop for all different types of pointers. Currently there are no dedicated network trainings for specific types of pointers. There are two types of network structure, currently both are supported. The \"class100\" is a pure classification network, that might need a bit more accuracy in the labeling. \"cont\" is a no classic approach with a continuous output off only 2 neurons (details see below). Types of counters trained: Training data needs Quadratic images, minimum size: 32x32 pixel Typically 100 - 200 images with a resolution of 1/100 of the full rotation (every 0.1 value or 3.6\u00b0) Naming: x.y_ARBITRARY.jpg, where x.y = value 0.0 ... 9.9 CNN Technical details: Input 32 x 32 RGB images Output ana-cont _XXX.tflite: 2 neurons with output in range [-1, 1] - representing a sinus / cosine encoding of the angle needs to be converted to angle with arctan-hyperbolic function ana-class100 _XXX.tflite 100 neurons representing the classes from 0.0, 0.1, ... 9.8, 9.9 Digits with 11 classes (\"dig-class11_XXX.tflite\") The digit type is a classical classification network, with 11 classes representing the numbers 0, 1, ... 9 and the special class \"N\". It is trained for the rolling ring of gas and electric meters. As there is sometime a status between two images, the special class \"N\" is representing Not-A-Number for the case, that the image cannot be unique classified to one number e.g. because it is between two digits. For this type the lowest amount of training data per type is needed, resulting in a large variety of type being already part of the training set. Types of counters trained: Training data needs RGB images, with minimum size: 20x32 pixel Typically 10 - 20 images (1-2 for each digit and an arbitrary number for the \"N\" class Naming: x_ARBITRARY.jpg, where x = value 0 ... 9 + N CNN Technical details: Input 20 x 32 RGB images Output 11 neurons for image classification (last layer normalized to 1) Neuron 0 to 9 represent the corresponding numbers \"0\" to \"9\" Neuron 10 represents the \"Not-A-Number\" class, telling, that the image is not uniquely classified Digits with rolling results (\"dig-class100_XXX.tflite\" & \"dig-cont_XXX.tflite\") This type of network tries to overcome the problem, that there are intermediate values, when a rolling digit is between two numbers. Previous this was the \"N\" class. In this network type, there are also sub-digit values trained, so that the intermediate state can be used as additional information for the algorithms.

Parameter <NUMBER>.MaxRateType Default Value: AbsoluteChange Defines if the Change Rate is calculated as the difference between the last two readings ( AbsoluteChange = difference) or as the difference normalized to the interval ( RateChange = difference per minute). Parameter <NUMBER>.MaxRateValue Default Value: 0,05 Maximum allowed change between two readings, if exceeded the last reading will be rejected. Depending on the settings of <NUMBER>.MaxRateType the MaxRateValue is either treated as the difference between the two measurements ( AbsoluteChange = difference) not taking the set time interval into account or as the difference normalized to the interval ( RateChange = difference per minute). If negative rate is disallowed and no maximum rate value is set, one false high reading will lead to a period of missing measurements until the measurement reaches the previous false high reading. E.g. if the counter is at 600,00 and it's read incorrectly as 610,00 , all measurements will be skipped until the counter reaches 610,00 . Setting the MaxRateValue to 0,05 leads to a rejection of all readings with a difference > 0,05 , in this case 610,00 . The rejection also applies to correct readings with a difference > 0,05 !

See Collect images to improve the models on how to collect new training data. Precondition Please make sure to have: Setup your camera properly and taken a good Reference Image . Selected good Alignment References . Define the ROIs For each digit or analog pointer, a ROI must be defined. You can even have multiple independent Numbers (eg. electerical meters mostly have 2 numbers for the high and low tariff). Depending if you have only one of those types, you can enable/disable (1) it on the top left corner: You can switch between the individual ROIs with the Drop down box (2) . If you need additional ROIs or delete them you can do this with the control at (3) . Like for the Alignment References , you can change the position, size and name of a ROI in the text fields or define them via drag and drop through the mouse button. Make sure the ROIs are in the right order, matching the significance of a digit/analog counter! Warning The order of the ROIs defines how the individual digits are combined to the total number. The first ROI is the digit with the highest order (left side), then the second and so on. You can control the order in the selector tab and change it with the buttons \"move Next\" or \"move Previous\" . In most cases digits are ordered equidistantly (have the same distance between each other) and have the same size. Because of this, the Web Interface keeps their sizes and distance the same. If you need individual sizes or distances, untick the settings (4) . In almost all cases the sizes and y values should be identical! The ratio between x and y might need adjustment. But make sure it is the same for all digits. Same for the analog counters , the sizes should be identical and the x and y as well. Note Don't forget to save the settings with \"Save\" and do not reboot at this stage. Analog Counters For analog counters the ROI setting is rather straight forward as the meter is usually quadratic with a clear center. The circle should exactly fit to the outer size of the meter and the cross should be in the middle of the pointer. Here is an example with the details for the ROI ana1 : Digits For the Digital Meters it is a little bit more complicated, as there are different options of digital models which can be choosen. Correct Size for ROI First of all, choose the right size of the ROI. The configuration of ROIs differs a bit on the selected model (see below). If you are in the initial setup, the model will be selectable in the next step. By default it is a dig-cont resp. ana-cont model. In Model Selection you find the differences between the different available models. Pick the one you think fits best your purpose. If you don't get to good result, try another model. Here we only show the different configuration of the ROIs. Digital Meters with only recognized full digits ( 0, 1, 2, 3, ... 9 ) Suggested Model: dig-class11-*.tfl Advantage: broad variety of types included in the training. Disadvantage: partially rotated numbers cannot be detected. Digital Meters with sub-digit resolution ( 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, .... 9.8, 9.9 ) Suggested Model: dig-cont-*.tfl or dig-class100-*.tfl Advantage: partial numbers can be detected and a better post processing is possible. Disadvantage: only limited types of meter types are trained due to the high effort for the training data. How to setup the digit ROIs perfectly Details and the corresponding \"perfect\" setting is explained below. For a first run you can choose the following general settings: There is an inner and an outer frame for the ROIs. Make the inner frame exactly the size of the number. Example 1 Example 2 \u2714\ufe0f Okay \u274c Not Okay \u274c Not Okay Setup using dig-class11 models dig-class11 - Models recognize the complete digit only . Here it is not relevant if the ROI fits the Border of the digit window. For this model, there should be a border of 20% of the image size around the number itself. This border is shown in the ROI setup image by the inner thinner rectangle. This rectangle should fit perfectly around the number when the number has not started to rotate to the next position: Example 1 Example 2 \u2714\ufe0f Okay \u274c Not Okay \u274c Not Okay If you have perfect alignment and still are not getting satisfying results, most probably your numbers are not part of the training data yet. See Collect images to improve the models on how to collect new training data. Setup using dig-class100 or dig-cont Models These models recognize the tenths (fractions) between the numbers. Those models require a different ROI setup; the height must be set differently and more accurately . First, the width can be set like for a dig-class11 model, i.e. 20% margin left and right. The height of the outer rectangle should be set to the upper and lower edge of the number window. To achieve this, you might need to unlock the aspect ratio: Here an example: Example 1 \u2714\ufe0f Okay \u274c Not Okay Saving Once you are done, push Save to persist your setup.

Focus This is the first time, where you have access to the camera image. It most likely is out of focus and not sharp! Ensure a sharp image of the camera by adjusting the focal length of the ESP OV2640 camera. Note Try to adjust the focus for the clearest possible image! In order to use it for reading a meter, the focal-length of the OV2640 camera has to be manipulated.

After this you can rotate the lens in and out. Rotating it by about a quarter of a turn counterclockwise results in a focus plane shift of about 10cm. You need to figure out your best setting with a little bit of trial and error for your specific environment. Error Be very carefully when rotating the lens.

If your digits are included or at least very similar to included images, the chance is very high that the neural network is working fine for you as well.

Either use the Backup/Restore function of your device for this (menu System > Backup/Restore ) or back the files manually up using the File Server (menu File Server , folder config ). It is recommended to at least save the config file config.ini ! Head to the menu System > OTA Update and follow the instructions there. If you do an update between major versions, it might be needed to modify the config file config.ini as it's syntax or context has changed. To do so, go to the menu Settings > Configuration (after the update completed and the device restarted) and check if it warns you about an unset parameter. Update from version v12.0.0 or newer You can use the over the air update mechanism, which uploads the update via a ZIP files. The update file is located on the release page . Please choose the zip file with the following naming: AI-on-the-edge-device__update__*.zip Go to the menu System --> OTA Update and follow the instructions there. After a final automatic reboot you should have the new version running.
